<p>### High-Reliable 3D Network-on-Chip</p>

<p>I enrolled PhD course at <a href="http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp">The University of Aizu</a> 
and work at <a href="http://aslweb.u-aizu.ac.jp/">Adaptive Systems Laboratory</a> on research about
<a href="http://aslweb.u-aizu.ac.jp/wiki/index.php?Research#dddd8273">Reliable Many-core 3D-NoC Processor 
targeted for Real-Time Vision Applications</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hdl-noodles">HDL Noodles</h3>

<p>HDL Noodles is open-source repositories for Hardware Description Language
 which are named as noodles. They will be mainly written in VHDL 
 and verilog. Here is <a href="https://github.com/hdl-noodles">Github link</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to join or provide any contributions, please email me at dnk0904 [at sign] gmail.com.</p>

<p>List of noodles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#spaghetti">Spaghetti</a>: All of sub-modules you need in HDL.</li>
  <li><a href="#pho">Pho</a>: A simple 8 bit CPU.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="spaghetti">Spaghetti</h4>

<p>Project Spaghetti provides every sub-modules which are needed for HDL design. 
You can find it in github: <a href="https://github.com/hdl-noodles/spaghetti">link</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pho">Pho</h4>

<p>In project Pho, I aim to build a very simple 8 bit CPU. It was named as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho">Pho</a> - one of the most famous Vietnamese noodle. 
Since I started this project in Feb. 2015, you may not see any code in my 
<a href="https://github.com/hdl-noodles/pho">github repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="inter-prediction-of-h264avc-encoder">Inter-Prediction of H.264/AVC Encoder</h3>

<p>I designed in VHDL a Inter-Prediction part of H.264/AVC Encoder at <a href="http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn">SIS Lab</a>. 
This module uses reference frame and current frame of video to find out the relationship between them. 
Normally, in current frame, some objects moved and some object and background stay as same as
reference frames. As finding this motion (standardize as motion vector with pixel or sub-pixel unit) 
and just compress the difference value, encoder can obtain significant smaller bit-rate. 
This work is published in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2014.6868813">paper</a>.</p>
